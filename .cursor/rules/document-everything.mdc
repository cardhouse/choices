- Every **function**, **class**, and **method** must have a **docblock** explaining:
  - What it does
  - Its parameters and return values
  - Any important side effects

- For complex logic, include **inline comments** describing the purpose of key steps and decisions.

- Use **section headers** (e.g., `/** Validation */`) to separate logical parts of the code.

- Include **rationale** for chosen implementations if not self-evident. This helps explain **why** something is done a certain way.

- Document **limitations**, **assumptions**, or **trade-offs** made during implementation.

- Avoid vague or redundant comments (e.g., `// do something`). Be precise and useful.
